	<p>Nigeria, the land of my ancestors; 
		the nation where I was birthed. Nigeria is a beautiful country endowed with abundant human and natural resources.

		With a population that exceeds 
		200 million people, there are ample opportunities, especially for international trade.
		
		</p>
		<br>

		<p>Nigeria is abundantly blessed with natural resources, boasting as the largest producer and exporter of oil in Africa, and the 11th largest in the whole wide world.

			With the resources at the country’s disposal, it’s no surprise that it has the largest economy in Africa.
			
			In a utopian world, Nigeria would’ve been one of the most powerful countries on earth and a desirable investment spot.
			
			However, that’s sadly not the case.
			
			It’s been 61 years since the nation gained her independence, and she’s still far off from reaching her full potential.
			
			In 1960, when Nigeria became independent, the world had its eyes on the most populous black nation, and for the right reasons.
			
			</p>

			<p>Nigeria officially referred to as the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a federal state in West Africa. It borders Cameroon and Chad to the East, Benin to the west, and Niger to the north. It also has a coast in the south that lies on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. Nigeria is made up of 36 cities and the Federal Capital Territory, where Abuja, the capital city is situated. Nigeria has a lot of historic empires and cultures compared to other countries in Africa. The history of Nigeria can be traced back to as early as 11,000 BC when a number of ancient African communities inhabited the area that now makes Nigeria. The greatest and the well-known empire that ruled the region before the British arrived was the Benin Empire whose ruler was known as Oba of Benin. Other tribes such as the Nri Kingdom also settled in the country, especially in the Eastern side. The Songhai Empire also settled in some of the country’s territory. By the 11th century, Islam had arrived in Nigeria via the Hausa States. In 1851, the British forces seized Lagos, which was later annexed officially in 1861. In 1901, Nigeria was made a British protectorate and was colonized until 1960, when the country gained independence. In 1963, Nigeria became a republic but fell under military rule in 1966 as a result of a coup d'état. In 1967, the Republic of Biafra was formed and this led to the three-year Nigerian Civil War. The country became a republic again in 1979 after a new constitution was drafted. The republic, however, did not last for long because the military under the leadership of Major General Muhammadu Buhari seized the country four years later. A new republic was formed in August 1993 after Buhari was overthrown but was once again dissolved in November the same year by General Sani Abacha who passed on in 1998, leading to the creation of a forth republic in 1999. With the above in mind, the country’s history will be discussed in brief below.</p>

			<h1>Early History of Nigeria (500BC – 1500)</h1>

			<img src="../img/images.jpg" class="111" alt="map">

			<br>
        

			<p>Between 500 BC and 200 AD, the Nok civilization living in Northern Nigeria thrived in the territory. They made life-sized terracotta sculptures which are among the earliest recognized figures in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other cities further north such as Katsina and Kano also have a history that dates to around 999AD. During this era, the Kanem-Bornu Empire and the Hausa kingdoms flourished as trade points between West and North Africa. In the 10th century, the Igbo people of the Nri Kingdom merged. The kingdom, however, lost its power to the British in 1911. The city if Nri is believed to be the cornerstone of Igbo culture. In the 12th and 14th centuries respectively, the Yoruba kingdoms of Ife and Oyo in the southwest region of Nigeria attained prominence. The first evidence of human civilization at Ife’s present-day location go way back to the 9th century whose main culture included bronze and terracotta sculptures.</p>
            <h1>currency in Nigeria </h1>
			
			<img src="../img/currency.jpg" alt="">

			<p>naira, monetary unit of Nigeria. The naira is divided into 100 kobo. The naira was introduced in 1973, when the country decimalized its monetary system and substituted the naira for the Nigerian pound (the country used the British pound sterling when it was a British colony), which was divided into shillings.</p>

			<p>The Central Bank of Nigeria has the sole authority to issue banknotes and coins. Coin denominations range from 1/2 kobo to 1 naira. Banknotes are denominated in values from 5 to 500 naira. Most of the banknotes contain images of previous political leaders important in Nigeria’s history; for example, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Nigeria’s first prime minister, is pictured on the 5-naira note, and Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria’s first president, is on the 500-naira note.</p>
